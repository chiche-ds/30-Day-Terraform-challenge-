# Day 6: Understanding Terraform State

## Overview

Welcome to Day 6 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, we will focus on understanding Terraform's state and how to manage it effectively. You'll dive deep into the role of state in Terraform, how it impacts infrastructure management, and the importance of securing and maintaining it across different environments. We will also explore different backends for storing state remotely to ensure team collaboration and consistency.
