# Day 5: Scaling Infrastructure

## Overview

Welcome to Day 5 of the Terraform 30-Day Challenge! Today, we will focus on scaling your infrastructure and deepening your understanding of Terraform's state. You'll learn about scaling your infrastructure to handle increased load, understand the importance of state in Terraform, and explore how to manage state effectively. the key learnig objective today is understanding how the defferent block work together.

## Tasks for Today

### 1. **Reading**
   - **Chapter**: Complete Chapter 2 and start Chapter 3 how to manage Terraform state.
     - Sections: "Scaling Infrastructure" and "Terraform State".
   - **Goal**: Understand the concepts of scaling infrastructure and the importance of managing Terraform state.

### 2. **Videos**
   - **Udemy**: Watch the following videos:
     - "Terraform data block " (Video 19)
     - "Terraform configuration block" (Video 20)
     - "Terraform module block" (Video 21)
     - "Terraform output block " (Video 22)
   - **Goal**: Understanding how the different block operate and when to use them in your terraform code .

### 3. **Activity**
   - **Scale Infrastructure**: Use Terraform to scale your web server cluster to handle increased load.
   - **understand  State**: understand the concept of state. what happens when you manully update the state file.
   - **Bonus**: Do a comparism table of the different block we have learn so far and where is use and a code sample.
   - **Goal**: Successfully Deploy a load balancer and understand state .

### 4. **Blog Post**
   - **Title**: "mananging high traffic applications with aws elastic load balanacer and terraform"

### 5. **Social Media Post**
   - **Text**: "🚀 Scaled my infrastructure with aws elactic load balancer today and using Terraform! #30daytfchallenge #HUG #hashicorp #HUGYDE @chiche #IaC"
